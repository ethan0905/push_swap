# push_swap ðŸ§®
You're gonna need to sort a random list of numbers, using two stacks and with the less amount of moves. To do so, you're gonna manipulate the stacks using only allowed movements: swap (sa, sb, ss), rotate (ra, rb, rr), reverse (rra, rrb, rrr) and push (pa, pb)

## Algorithm made: Intelligent Insertion sort  
  
Goal in this project is to create an algorithm that can sort the list with the less amount of moves.  
  
There is tons of sorting algorithms, but we want to work on one that gonna be enought efficient, and not to hard to develop.  That why i created my own algorithm, that think by himself, and take good decisions.  

  Step 1: I am pushing all number from the stack A to the stack B. If that number is < to the median number of the final stack, I push it to B (pb) then I rotate it in order to make it goes under the stack (rb). Else, if that number is > to the median, I am simply pushing it to B (pb). This way, we have a pre-sorted stack on B, with 2 blocks of numbers, the big ones and the small ones.  
  Step 2: I check the first number of my stack B (stackB[0]) and count how much moves I am gonna need in order to push it on right spot in A. Then I am checking how much moves I am going to need for pushing the stackB[1] in on the right spot in A, and so on... When I did this on all my stackB, I push to A only the one that needed the less amount of moves.  
  Step 3: I am repeating the operation till there is no more number in B.  

## Performances  
  
| | Required for 5/5 | Mine |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| For 5 numbers:  | < 12 moves | 5-11 moves |
| For 100 numbers:  | < 700 moves | 500-670 moves |
| For 500 numbers:  | < 5500 moves | 4300-4900 moves |
